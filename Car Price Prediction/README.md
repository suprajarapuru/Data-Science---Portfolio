*****Predicting the Car Price*****

A project on predicting the price of cars using vehicle dataset.
This project is tested over more than one ml models like ExtraTreesRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, random forest,
Out of these models GradientBoostingRegressor performed very well giving an accuracy of 85.28 and mse of 0.52 far better than others.
I had use quantilTransformer to solve the skeweness.
