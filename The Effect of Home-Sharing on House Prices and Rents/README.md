*****Project: Analysis of how AirBnB rentals prices affects the nearby housing rental prices in Chicago*****


****Introduction****

Airbnb, Inc operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. The platform is accessible via website and mobile app. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking.
The company has been criticized for a direct correlation between increases in the number of its listings and increases in nearby rent prices and creating nuisances for those living near leased properties.
The problem here I am addressing is how the the prices of Chicago AirBnB rentals affect the prices of the nearby neighborhood rent prices.
Data science algorithm will help here to predict the prices of Chicago AirBnB rentals and also help to understand the correlation between the prices of Chicago AirBnB rentals and neighborhood rent prices.
