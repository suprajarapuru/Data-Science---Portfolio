*****Project Title: Predicting the Risk parameters for Cardiovascular patients*****

****Introduction****

Cardiovascular Disease often used interchangeably with “heart disease”, generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead 
to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves, or rhythm, also are considered 
forms of heart disease.

The purpose of this project is to predict the effects of different parameters recorded in the data to predict mortality of the patient. 
By predicting so the physicians can determine high risk patients and can take better care of them thus helping them survive.
