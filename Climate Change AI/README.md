*****Project Motivation*****

Climate change is a globally relevant, urgent, and multi-faceted issue heavily impacted by energy policy and infrastructure. Addressing climate change involves mitigation (i.e. mitigating greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (i.e. preparing for unavoidable consequences). Mitigation of GHG emissions requires changes to electricity systems, transportation, buildings, industry, and land use.

According to a report issued by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the lifecycle of buildings from construction to demolition were responsible for 37% of global energy-related and process-related CO2 emissions in 2020. Yet it is possible to drastically reduce the energy consumption of buildings by a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art strategies. For example, retrofitted buildings can reduce heating and cooling energy requirements by 50-90 percent. Many of these energy efficiency measures also result in overall cost savings and yield other benefits, such as cleaner air for occupants. This potential can be achieved while maintaining the services that buildings provide.

*****Objective*****

In this project, I was interested in knowing what are the crucial impact factors for energy consumption of a building and use this information to predict an accurate Site EUI for each building. Below are the particular business questions which can be answered using this dataset.

1.Are those commercial buildings consuming more energy consumption than residential buildings?

2.Should we consider the priority of retrofitting for older buildings in order to eliminate the waste of energy more efficiently

3.What are the top crucial impact factors for the energy consumption of the buildings based on the observations of data?

*****Dataset*****

The dataset being used was retrieved from kaggle. This dataset was created in collaboration with Climate Change AI (CCAI) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab).
