****Propensity To Convert Models - Predicting the the likelihood of Customer accepting Personal Loan Offer*****

*****Introduction*****

Banks spend millions of dollars on marketing teams and the campaigns in targeting right customer, right channel where the response rate is higher when offer is made. Based on various studies made and the observation I have at my work, the response rate is very low, response rate is below 5% in personal loans space. The low acceptance rate means that randomly choosing customers to market to is incredibly wasteful in terms of both time and money. Thus, it is in the interest of the banks to determine which customers are the most likely to accept this type of loan based on the customer's information. Also the creatives that are being sent are looked at being more personalized so that message in the offer resonates with their situation and make the customers to accept the rate.
For my project, I am focusing only the persona/customer segmentation. 

Creative design and propensity rate of each creative is something would be further investigated outside of this work.  

For this project, I am aiming to apply the K-Means, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Perceptron, and Multi-layer Perceptron algorithms to predict whether customers will be willing to take on a personal loan. The input into our algorithms will be a customer's age, years of professional experience, annual income measured in thousands of dollars, home address, ZIP code, family size, average spending on credit cards per month measured in thousands, education level, and the value of a house mortgage (if the customer has any). Our algorithm will use this information to output a prediction on whether a customer will take a personal loan (1) or not (0).

In practice, marketing teams can optimize their spend on campaigns by targeting these customers who are likely to accept the offer.
