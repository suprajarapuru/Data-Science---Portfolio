*****Detecting fraudulent credit card operations with machine learning algorithms*****

This project will address the problem of credit card fraud, a major concern for banks and customers, and the process of detecting fraudulent operations through machine learning techniques.

The scam usually occurs when someone accesses your credit or debit card numbers from unsecured websites or via an identity theft scheme to fraudulently obtain money or property. Due to its recurrence and the harm it may cause to both individuals and financial institutions, it is crucial to take preventive measures as well as identifying when a transaction is fraudulent.
